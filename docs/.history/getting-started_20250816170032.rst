Dataset Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the interface is opened, the default view is the **Description**
section and a **side-by-side dimensional reduction view**. Each embedding can be colored by metadata
or by gene expression (selected from the
dropdown). The image below highlights how to quickly explore the dataset
to capture most of the key information.

**Data Selection:**  
Use the *Global Data Filter* to select or deselect cells displayed in
the embedding by categorical metadata. All embeddings stored in `.obsm` will be available in the
*Dimensional Reduction* panel. For dimensional reduction methods with
more than two axes, you may select at most two for display (`X-axis`
and `Y-axis`).

**Navigation and Tools:**  
- **Zooming:** Scroll to zoom in and out.  
- **Toolbar icons (top-right):**  
  - *Camera*: Download the current view as `.svg`.  
  - *Pan tool (middle icon):* Hold the space bar and drag to move the
    view; double-click to reset to default.  
  - *Lasso tool:* Select cells in the left embedding and pass them to
    other plots (see *Cell Selection* section).  

Marker Genes Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Heatmap
-------

GUANACO provides single-cell level heatmaps supporting up to **50,000
cells**. Cells (columns) and genes (rows) are controlled from the left
panel. If the dataset exceeds this limit, cells are automatically
binned. Three transformation options are available: **none, log, and
z-score**. For z-score, the top 99th percentile is used for better
visualization.

Heatmaps support **two annotations**; one may be continuous (e.g.,
pseudotime). By default, cells are clustered first by the primary
annotation and then by the secondary. If the secondary annotation is
continuous, ordering is prioritized by the continuous variable.

**Color settings:**  
- The discrete colormap for the first annotation matches the embedding
section.  
- The colormap for the secondary annotation can be chosen via dropdown.  
- A library of **96 continuous colormaps** is provided.  
  - Sequential colormaps are recommended for raw and log data.  
  - Diverging colormaps are recommended for z-score to highlight
    differences.

Violin Plot
-----------

GUANACO offers two violin plot types: **stacked** (for multiple markers)
and **split/grouped** (for group comparisons).

.. image:: assets/violin1.png
   :width: 1000

Colors are consistent with the embedding plots. Options include adding a
box plot inside the violin and/or scatter dots alongside. Note that
showing all scatter points may be slow for large datasets or multiple
genes.

**Split/grouped violin plots** allow clear group comparisons. Four
analysis modes are supported:

- **Mode 1:** Single metadata grouping  
  - Two groups → Mann–Whitney U test and t-test  
  - More than two groups → Kruskal–Wallis (KW) test and ANOVA  
- **Mode 2:** Facet by first metadata, compare second metadata  
  - Two groups → Mann–Whitney U test and t-test (split violin view)  
  - More than two groups → KW test and ANOVA (grouped violin view)  
- **Mode 3:** Linear model  
  - Adjusts for a confounder: `expression ~ obs1 + obs2`  
  - Useful for non-nested metadata (e.g., treatment and gender)  
- **Mode 4:** Mixed model  
  - Treats obs2 as a random effect: `expression ~ meta1 + (1|obs2)`  
  - Suitable for hierarchical structures (e.g., patient nested within
    condition)  

**Example Mode 2:**  
Target question: For each cell type, is there a difference in expression
between conditions?

.. image:: assets/violin2.png

**Example Mode 3:**  
Target question: Which metadata contributes more to group differences?

Dot Plot
--------

Dot plots summarize **aggregated expression** across groups and are
useful for displaying marker gene expression. GUANACO provides two plot
types:

- **Dot plot**  
- **Matrix plot (pseudo-bulk heatmap)**

.. image:: assets/dotplot.png
   :width: 1000

**Standardization** (0–1 scaling) is available to make genes directly
comparable across plots.

Stacked Bar Plot
----------------

Stacked bar plots illustrate **cell composition** across groups.
Annotation and labels on the left determine stacked layers, while
selection within the stacked bar tab defines the x-axis. Users can
display **proportions** or **absolute counts**. Hovering reveals more
details. Groups can be reordered by dragging column headers.

Pseudotime Plot
---------------

The Pseudotime Plot visualizes **gene expression dynamics along a
trajectory** (or other continuous metadata). A generalized linear model
(GLM) smooth line is fitted to highlight trends.

.. image:: assets/pseudotime.png
   :width: 1000

**Key Features**  
- Displays gene expression changes along pseudotime  
- Supports multiple genes in stacked subplots  
- Fits smoothed regression curves to highlight patterns  
- Colors points by grouping variable (e.g., cell type or cluster)  

**Interactive Controls**  
- Filter by minimum expression threshold  
- Transformation: None, Log, Z-score  
- Select pseudotime column if multiple are available  

**Use Cases**  
- Identify genes switching on/off during differentiation  
- Detect transitional cell state markers  
- Validate computational trajectory inference  
- Explore temporal gene regulation  

IGV Browser
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: assets/gb_motif.png
   :width: 1000

The IGV Browser tab integrates the **Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)**
for interactive exploration of genomic regions with multiple tracks
(e.g., gene annotations, ATAC-seq peaks, reference sequences). It also
includes a **motif search tool** for transcription factor binding
analysis using JASPAR IDs.

**Main Components**  
1. **Session Selector (left panel)**: Choose global or cell-type-specific
sessions  
2. **Genome Browser (center)**: Navigate, zoom, and explore aligned
tracks  
3. **Motif Search (right panel)**: Enter JASPAR ID to view motif details
and sequence logos  

**Use Cases**  
- Explore regulatory regions around genes of interest  
- Compare accessibility across cell types  
- Analyze transcription factor binding motifs  

Cell Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: assets/selection.png
   :width: 1000

Cell selection operates on **two layers**:

1. **Global Data Filter (categorical metadata)**  
   - Controls which cells are displayed in embeddings  
   - Access via *Show Filters* panel  
   - Select or clear metadata values, then apply  

2. **Lasso Selection (embedding plots)**  
   - Select cells interactively with the lasso tool  
   - Update other plots (heatmap, violin, etc.) with selected cells  

**Hierarchy:**  
All Cells → Global Filter → Lasso Selection → Subset in other plots

**Notes**  
- Global filter persists until changed  
- Lasso selections reset when metadata/genes change  
- If no lasso is applied, “Update Other Plots” passes all filtered cells  

Export Selected Subgroup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: assets/download.png
   :width: 1000

Selected cells can be exported in two formats:

1. **Cell IDs (.txt)**  
   - Plain text list of selected cell identifiers  
   - Useful for downstream tools or sharing subsets  

2. **Subset AnnData (.h5ad)**  
   - Full AnnData object of selected cells  
   - Includes expression, metadata, embeddings, and metrics  
   - Useful for deeper analysis, re-clustering, or sharing complete
     subsets
