After getting an understanding of what GUANACO is and what it does, here is the step-by-step instruction on how to use and run GUANACO successfully:

* The first thing the user needs is to create the AnnData (h5ad) or MuuData(h5mu) file of their experiment to visualize the single cell RNA data (if annotation is present, else not required)
* The user can also create a BigWig file for visualizing their open chromatin regions (if applicable). To run GUANACO either of the Annotation file or the BigWig file must be present.
* The user needs to create the config.json file properly following the instruction below
* Finally, the user can wrap everything in the Json file (updating information if needed) and run the app using system's Python or using Docker
