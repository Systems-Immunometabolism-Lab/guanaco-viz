# Running GUANACO from Console using system's Python

## Run Locally

To run GUANCO Locally follow the following steps:

To run and install GUANACO, only changes need to be made in the Json file and the AnnData or MuuData needs to be stored in the said folder as stated above. User also needs to make sure a stable version of Python is installed in their local machine, precisely a version of Python 3.10 or higher, if not please install Python first, then follow the mentioned steps using the terminal:

### Step 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Systems-Immunometabolism-Lab/guanaco-viz

cd guanaco-viz
```

It is advised to keep the Json file, and data inside this folder

<br>

### Step 2. Create a virtual environment for python

Create the virtual environment:
```bash
python –m venv myenv
```
Or (depending on the python and OS version)

```bash
python3 –m venv myenv
```
Then activate it:<br>

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```
Or For Windows
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
<br>

<u><b>If the user is using Conda follow the following commands:</b></u>
```bash
conda create -n guanaco-env

conda activate guanaco-env
```

<br>

<u><b>If the user is using Pixi follow the following commands:</b></u>
```bash
python –m venv pixienv
```
Or (depending on the python and OS version)

```bash
python3 –m venv pixienv
```
<br>

```bash
source pixienv/bin/activate
```
Or For Windows
```bash
pixienv\Scripts\activate
```
or
```bash
pixienv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
<br>

### Step 3. Install from local directory

```bash
pip install .
```

or

```bash
pip install –e .
```

(for development (editable install))

or

Install from distribution files if the user has the wheel file:

```bash
pip install dist/guanaco_viz-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Step 4. Run GUANACO

```bash
guanaco -c your_config.json
```

Along with this Json File the user can also mention the following changes, if anything different the user prefers:

* `guanaco -h` If the user needs any help
* `guanaco -d DATA_DIR` If the user doesn't have their data in the current directory but somewhere else, they can specify using this command: `guanaco -c your_config.json -d your_datadirectory`
* `guanaco -p PORT` If the user wants to run GUANACO in a different Port than the specified 4399 or run multiple instances of GUANACO simultaneously maybe with different config files, users can run it the following way: `guanaco -c your_2ndconfig.json -p your_newport`
* `guanaco --host HOST`  If the user wants to run GUANACO using a different IP other than the default 0.0.0.0, they can do it the following way: `guanaco -c your_2ndconfig.json --host your_newhost`
* `guanaco --debug` If in any case the user wants to understand and/or report any error they face for guanaco
* `guanaco --max-cells MAX_CELLS` This is because GUANACO by default, down samples data to only the top 8k cells, however, if the dataset has more than the mentioned number of cells, the user will definitely need to specify the total number of cells here in this format `guanaco -c your_2ndconfig.json --max-cells 10000`, this configuration is done to save memory consumption
* `guanaco --seed SEED` Here the seed can be set for sub sampling of the cells
* `guanaco --backed-mode` For heavy dataset this is recommended, else the app may crash depending on the RAM of the device. However, we would recommend this command for running GUANACO in general more efficiently `guanaco -c your_config.json -d your_datadirectory --backed-mode`. There is no need to use `--max-cells`if GUANACO is run using the `--backed-mode`

Users can use all the help at once like `guanaco -c your_config.json -d your_datadirectory -p your_newport –host yournewhost –seed 10 –debug --backed-mode`. However, the users cannot use just the command `guanaco` to run GUANACO because guanaco needs a config file to run properly.

<br>

### Or The User can also directly use our already made package

```bash
pip install guanaco

guanaco -d your_datadirectory -c your_config.json --backed-mode
```

**Note:** it is advised to keep the data file and the config file in the same directory in this case

The application will be running in http://0.0.0.0:4399/

There will also some other address provided to run the file locally in, user can choose either:

## Deploy in Server

To deploy GUANCO in the users AWS or any other Cloud Server follow the following steps:

To run and install GUANACO, only changes need to be made in the Json file and the AnnData or MuuData needs to be stored in the said folder as stated above.

Please note that the user must connect to their server for deployment. Connection can be made to the server using the following command (this depends completely on the server)

`ssh -i ~/filepath/my-aws-key.pem instance-name@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>`

**Note:** The instance name is mostly the name of the OS image used for the server like ubuntu or ec2-user for linux, in this case ubuntu is much preferable as it comes with updated version of python, however this again depends on the server operator

[This is Optional] User can also add NGINX as an added layer of security if not already done, however, NGINX is highly recommended for URL configuration and also if the link is shared with others

User also needs to make sure a stable version of Python is installed in the server, precisely a version of Python 3.10 or higher, if a lower version of Python is available it is advised to update the python version, then follow the mentioned steps using the terminal:

### Step 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Systems-Immunometabolism-Lab/guanaco-viz

cd guanaco-viz
```
It is advised to keep the Json file, and data inside this folder. The users can upload the files in the server using terminal command: `scp -i /path/to/your-key.pem /path/to/your/file ubuntu@EC2_PUBLIC_IP:/home/ubuntu/` or manual uploading through the interface. However, if the user is copying the repository in the server from interface, make sure the Json file and the AnnData in the folder as mentioned above.

<br>

### Step 2. Create a virtual environment for python

```bash
python –m venv myenv
```

Or, depending on the python version

```bash
python3 –m venv myenv
```

Or, if the instance default python is lower than 3.10, it is recommended to install a higher version and use this

```bash
python3.10 –m venv myenv
```
<br>

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

<br>

<u><b>If the user is using Conda follow the following commands:</b></u>
```bash
conda create -n guanaco-env

conda activate guanaco-env
```

<br>

<u><b>If the user is using Pixi follow the following commands:</b></u>
```bash
python –m venv pixienv
```
Or (depending on the python and OS version)

```bash
python3 –m venv pixienv
```
<br>

```bash
source pixienv/bin/activate
```
Or For Windows
```bash
pixienv\Scripts\activate
```

<br>

### Step 3. Install from local directory

```bash
pip install .
```

or

```bash
pip install –e .
```

(for development (editable install))

or

Install from distribution files if the user has the wheel file:

```bash
pip install dist/guanaco_viz-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

<br>

### Step 4. Run GUANACO

```bash
nohup guanaco -c your_config.json --backed-mode &
```

Along with this Json File the user can also mention the following changes, if anything different the user prefers:

* `guanaco -h` If the user needs any help
* `guanaco -d DATA_DIR` If the user doesn't have their data in the current directory but somewhere else, they can specify using this command: `guanaco -c your_config.json -d your_datadirectory`
* `guanaco -p PORT` If the user wants to run GUANACO in a different Port than the specified 4399 or run multiple instances of GUANACO simultaneously maybe with different config files, users can run it the following way: `guanaco -c your_2ndconfig.json -p your_newport`. However, make sure this port has been given the permission to be accessed in the security groups.
* `guanaco --host HOST`  This is not encouraged to use for server as each server comes with a default public IP and also this IP will be used to map any possible web url.
* `guanaco --debug` If in any case the user wants to understand and/or report any error they face for guanaco. Not recomended for sever
* `guanaco --max-cells MAX_CELLS` This is because GUANACO by default, down samples data to only the top 8k cells, however, if the dataset has more than the mentioned number of cells, the user will definitely need to specify the total number of cells here in this format `guanaco -c your_2ndconfig.json --max-cells 10000`, this configuration is done to save memory consumption
* `guanaco --seed SEED` Here the seed can be set for sub sampling of the cells
* `guanaco --backed-mode` For heavy dataset this is recommended, else the app may crash depending on the RAM of the device. However, we would recommend this command for running GUANACO in general more efficiently `guanaco -c your_config.json -d your_datadirectory --backed-mode`. There is no need to use `--max-cells`if GUANACO is run using the `--backed-mode`

Users can use all the help at once like `guanaco -c your_config.json -d your_datadirectory -p your_newport –seed 10 --backed-mode`. However, the users cannot use just the command `guanaco` to run GUANACO because guanaco needs a config file to run properly.

<br>

### Or The User can also directly use our already made package

```bash
pip install guanaco

nohup guanaco -d your_datadirectory -c your_config.json --backed-mode &
```

**Note:** it is advised to keep the data file and the config file in the same directory in this case

The application will be running in http://<instance-public-ip>:4399/ (or the url the IP is mapped to)
